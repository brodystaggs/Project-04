# Project-04

# Overview
During making this project I built off of Exercise 04d. This allowed me to have the enemies and the foundation to continue on. Overall I made a couple extra levels and an end screen. One of the levels I created kind of reminds me of flappy bird just because of the pipes that it has in the level. I tried to change scenary between snowy and a regular setting. This adds some visuals for the user to look and feel as though they are progressign through the levels. Yes, there are only four levels but they all have there own different stile to them.

The first level kind of gives the user the feel for the game by jumping and moving left and right.
Level 2 intesifies a llittle bit by adding an enemy but also having bigger jumps with bigger consequences like falling off the map.
Level 3 makes the user be a little more strategic with their jumps by adding tighter landing zones and windows to jump through. Mixed in with falling off the map.
The last level is like a mix between all of the levels but just going vertical. if you fall you may land on a lower block or you will fall of the map.
